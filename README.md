## Dependencies

This script also depends upon [`LodashGS`](https://github.com/contributorpw/lodashgs), which can be added per [its instructions](https://github.com/contributorpw/lodashgs#adding-the-library-to-your-project). (As of writing, use project key `1SQ0PlSMwndIuOAgtVJdjxsuXueECtY9OGejVDS37ckSVbMll73EXf2PW` when adding a library in Google Scripts).
